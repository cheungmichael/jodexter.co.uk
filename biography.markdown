<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>“Subtle”&#8230;“elegant”&#8230;“engaging.”<br>
Just some reviewers&#8217; descriptions of the soprano Joanne Dexter.</p>
<p>Over the years she has worked with a colourful array of performers from celebrated baritones Bryn Terfel and Sir Thomas Allen to comic legend Ken Dodd and Strictly Come Dancing judge Craig Revel Horwood.</p>
<p>From an early age Joanne seemed destined to become a singer. She was raised in a musical family and later trained at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, now renamed the <a href="http://www.rcs.ac.uk/">Royal Conservatoire of Scotland</a>.</p>
<p>Now, as a professional soprano, Joanne is able to cross the musical genres with apparent ease. As a member of <a href="http://www.operanorth.co.uk/">Opera North</a> she has performed across the spectrum of operatic challenges &#8211; from Mozart to Puccini and from Verdi to Britten.</p>
<p>Her Concert Platform and Oratorio repertoire is extensive, whether it be the baroque of Bach or Handel, the emotion of Dvorak&#8217;s Stabat Mater or the searing drama of Sondheim&#8217;s Sweeney Todd.</p>
<p>As a concert performer her love for the musicals and her take on some of pop music&#8217;s greatest hits gives her the opportunity to demonstrate a lighter side. Internationally, she has performed in Japan, Italy, Germany, Spain and France and is frequently seen and heard on BBC TV and radio.</p>
