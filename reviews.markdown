<p>&ldquo;The most subtle and eloquent performance of the evening came from Joanne Dexter in the role of Drusilla.&rdquo;<br><span>Opera Magazine</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Soprano Joanne Dexter was the true highlight of the evening. Generous in tone and emotion, she delivered an intelligent and engaging performance. The final aria &lsquo;If God be for us&rsquo; was perfect.&rdquo;<br><span>Huddersfield Examiner</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Soprano Joanne Dexter&#8217;s rich low register was beautifully deployed as she sang Deh Vieni from Mozart&#8217;s The Marriage of Figaro. One Fine Day from Madam Butterfly showed she had vocal strength. Then, in the duet from Puccini&#8217;s La Boheme she gave us some ravishing pianissimo.&rdquo;<br><span>Ilkley Gazette</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Joanne Dexter&#8217;s rendition of Now The Guns Have Stopped was sheer joy steeped in intense emotion and feeling&rdquo;<br><span>Karl Jenkins’ The Armed Man with the Yorkshire Chamber Orchestra.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The delight of the work came where Joanne Dexter was able to demonstrate her remarkable skill&#8230;I could have listened to her all night.&rdquo;<br><span>John Rutter’s Magnificat</span></p>
